## Bowling Game
See the original [presentation](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

This kata demonstrates the power of doing tests first, and how up-front design decisions can change
and give way to a simpler implementation by coding iteratively.

Write a `BowlingGame` object with methods `roll(pins)` and `getScore()`.

This will be the game engine which follows the rules of bowling:

* The game consists of 10 frames, in each frame the player has the ability to knock down 10 pins.
* The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down + bonuses for `strikes` and `spares`.
* A `spare` is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in 2 tries. The bonus for a spare is the next roll.
* A `strike` is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in 1 try. The bonus is the next 2 rolls.
* In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare / strike gets an extra roll(s) to complete the frame.
* No more than 3 rolls can be rolled in the 10th frame.
