# Inmate Kata

Greegko and Piotr are both prisoners, locked in a solitude in separate cells. They cannot communicate in oral, just though letters and code. There's nothing else left for them to live other than improving their coding quality together.. 15 minutes at a time.

## Rules

- You can only write 1 test a day which must be set as "skip". (your inmate can unskip it on his turn).
- You can only unskip 1 test a day.
- You can't write functionality that's not tested.
- Use only github for communication (issues, comments on commits, code, docs, etc)
- Do not *read* already done implementations and pseudocode about the problem, discuss the options instead.

## Hardcore rules

- You can only spend 15 minutes a day actively developing in this repo.

## Testing

To run the tests one shot
```
yarn jest
```

To run the tests in *watch* mode

```
yarn jest --watch
```
