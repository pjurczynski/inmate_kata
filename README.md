# Inmate Kata

Greegko and Piotr are both prisoners, locked in a solitude. There's nothing else left for them other than improving their coding quality together.. 15 minutes at a time.

## Rules

- You can only write 1 test a day which must be set as "skip". (your inmate can unskip it on his turn).
- You can only unskip 1 test a day.
- You can't write functionality that's not tested.
- Use only github for communication (issues, comments on commits, code, docs, etc)

## Hardore rules

- You can only spend 15 minutes a day actively developing in this repo.
